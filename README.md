# volumetric-balance-leaching-area

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing a volumetric balance for heaps and ponds in the leaching area of a mining operation. The goal is to have the complete leaching circuit with its daily hydraulic balance, which includes the piles, pools and different sectors
This implies data reconciliation since not all input data is reliable, nor is there all the necessary instrumentation to measure the flows.

## Objectives
- Perform a volumetric balance using data from heaps and ponds.
- Integrate field instrumentation and lab data into a Python-based analysis.
- Reconcile data to perform hydraulic balances
- Generate visualizations and summary reports for decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scipy
- **Data Sources**: Field sensors and lab data
- **Data Visualization**: Jupyter Notebooks

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Includes the Jupyter notebook with the main analysis.
- `results/`: Contains the visualizations in Power BI
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project.
