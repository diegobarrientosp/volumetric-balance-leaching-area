# volumetric-balance-leaching-area

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing a volumetric balance for ponds in the leaching area of a mining operation. The goal is to have the complete leaching circuit with its daily hydraulic balance.
This notebook aims to perform the steady-state balance, so that data reconciliation can then be worked on. The final product for the user area is a visualization of the circuit in Power BI.


## Objectives
- Perform a volumetric balance using data from heaps and ponds.
- Integrate different process dabatbases into a Python-based analysis.
- Generate visualizations and summary reports for decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Library**: pandas
- **Data Sources**: Different process dabatbases

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Includes the Jupyter notebook with the main analysis.
- `results/`: Contains the visualizations in Power BI
- `SQL Query/`: Contains the query in SQL to obtain specific data used in the notebook
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project.
